i yearn only for what is impossible
although, i should say, 
just what is not probable
or, perhaps, only the intangable
as all things impossible, are simply not so
but only what i judge improbable.

to soar a great distance
yet mesh with the sky
to live as the cloud.

to move not an inch
yet be in all places
to live as the oak.

such lovely things
i do deem intangable
yet i learn for them so.

i may accomplish all that is possible
although, i should say, 
just what i know
or, perhaps, only the avalible
as all things possible, are simply not so
but only what i judge that i know.

to be just, as the judge 
yet show compassion
to redeem in our world.

to stray not from thyself
yet be open to all
to redeem in thy soul.

such lovely things
i do deem avalible
and i may accomplish them so.

how may one live such as this?

to desire most the intangible
to surmount only the availble
a query i pose
to thyself, to none, and yet all.

because to yearn is to dream
and in a dream, there is a will, 
and there is a hope.

and hope may just be,
the most beauitful thing.

because to accomplish is to triumph
and in triumph, there is pride,
and there is a light.

and what may just be
the most beauitful thing
doth not dwell in darkness.

so with will, comes triumph
as all things are possible
so with triumph, comes pride
for no thing is impossible.

so, then,
with pride, comes light!
for darkness may not birth glory.

for such lovely things
available, improbable, and all inbetween;
are truly just the same.

for such lovely things,
are all, just that;
lovely.

i do just one thing
to see hope in all places,
i keep open eyes.

i do just one thing
to see hope in all faces,
i dwell not in darkness.

and so, 
i do live, this way.
to swim as light in the sky
to swim with light in the sky.

for with light, comes hope
surely the most beauitful thing.
