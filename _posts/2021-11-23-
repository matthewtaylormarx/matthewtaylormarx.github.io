On the idea that "reality has multiple 'levels' that correspond to the different levels of mechanisms": I think that this is true and is most likely an advantage of mechanisitic explanation. So reality can definitely be broken down into different 'levels' of mechanisms, providing a way to further categorize and analyze the composition and interaction of mechanisms. I immediately want to decide how these levels are defined, by what standard? Orders of magnitude? Sub-atomic, atomic, molecular, chemical? It is really a lot to think about.

Everything is interwoven. There is a favorite euphemism of mine in french: "le battement d'ailes du papillon", or, the flapping of the butterflies wings. Loosely translated also to mean happenstance. Chaos theory. The idea that a minimal action such as the fluttering of a butterflies wings on one side of the world directly results in a cascading wave of change across the world to impact something on a much greater scale or of deemed importance. There are no meaningless events. The lone bacteria in the bottom of the pond dictates the ecosystem of the surroundings and impacts the food chain which impacts the human settlement nearby etc. The flapping of butterflies wings is the tipping point which leads to a cascade of wind pressure which merges which another current ending in a hurricane. 

Broken down into levels: atomic, chemical, physical/force, time, emotional, electrical... we can start to see the patterns within a defined set that relates to each other and how then it relates to the levels it interacts with, above and below.

Then you could also define the levels as the mechanisms within mechanisms. It provides a good framework for describing and categorizing the composition of mechanisms, how they came to be, all the way down. Its not too "metaphysicsy", I think that these are the exact type of things I think of when I think of what philosophy is. If something is too far out for even the notion of the ponderance of thought itself, then where does it land? Is there even a thing as TOO metaphysical? In assessing the nature of reality, don't we want to go to the extreme, with everything we have?
