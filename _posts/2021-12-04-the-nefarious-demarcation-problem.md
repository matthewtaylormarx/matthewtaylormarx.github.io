Responding to the nefarious demarcation problem is no slight task. Such has been the discussion of countless philosophers over time; I feel a strange sense of belonging to this eternal community of philosophers. We are connected, for I am about to embark on something so many before me have attempted.

Here is the big difference between pseudo-science and real, actual science: pseudo-sciences exist in a vacuum. In science, no man is an island. The social aspect is important: communities of intellectuals are necessary and responsible for a large portion of what we define as scientific progress in our age, or paradigm.

So, what do I mean when I say pseudo-sciences are in a vacuum?

They may technically change and build on themselves (but do so largely remain unchanged in form over time, I would argue), the distinction being that they do not interact with other forms of science or allow science to disprove them.

The astrologist is un-phased when the physicist shows no evidence for the bearing of planetary masses on anything that resembles what astrology attempts to explain.

It cuts itself off from disproving evidence, its own existence as a thing is all that is needed to justify its existence. Science should, if not already, be classified welcoming to allow its refutation. Scientists know this brings new knowledge to the world about the nature of reality. How many times have falsified theories given birth to those we hold dear and true as laws today? Built upon the charred corpse of its former self, science is science because it willingly sacrifices itself to the flame of invention and great revelation; to be reborn as something stronger, more accurate, more true, more impactful to us, as conscious observers and partakers of the universe in which we reside.

Pseudo-sciences will always adapt to ensure their own survival by virtue of being a "thing" that cannot be refuted, their partakers or practices influenced by the notion of the thing that offers convenient explanation of some phenomena or characteristic that we or the world possess.

Like moth to flame, and I hesitate as I type this for fear of in-eloquence; weaker minds are drawn to simpler "truths".

In science there is no easy way out.

Our world and reality is an incredible cacophony of processes with near unending complexity. The only way out is through; we must constantly reevaluate what we hold to be true and not be afraid of the consequences of the crumbling of our belief, but to charge headlong into that wall, up against it, to see if it will break. That is science.
